# Pixar-Style Articulated Lamp – Three.js 💡

## About the Project
This project is a **3D animated articulated lamp** inspired by the iconic Pixar lamp, developed as part of the **Computer Graphics (Three.js)** course.

The goal of the project was to explore **hierarchical modeling**, **animation**, and **lighting techniques** in a 3D environment using **Three.js**.  
The lamp is composed of multiple articulated components that move in a coordinated way, simulating realistic mechanical behavior.

---

## Project Objectives
- Create a hierarchical 3D model with articulated joints
- Implement coordinated animations between objects
- Explore lighting and shadow projection in Three.js
- Develop basic user interaction in a 3D scene

---

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Three.js
- WebGL

---

## Interactions
- **Button:** Turn the lamp light on and off

---

## Lighting & Shadows
- Directional light emitted from the lamp head
- Real-time shadow projection in the scene
- Dynamic illumination of the environment and text

---

## My Contribution
- Modeling of articulated components
- Implementation of hierarchical transformations
- Animation logic and sequencing
- Lighting and shadow configuration
- User interaction (light toggle)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/kenLukau31/pixar-style-lamp-threejs.git`
2. Open the project using a local server  
   (required for Three.js assets)
   ```bash
   npx serve
