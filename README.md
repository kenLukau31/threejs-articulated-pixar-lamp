# Pixar-Style Articulated Lamp – Three.js 💡

This project is a **3D animated articulated lamp** inspired by the iconic Pixar lamp

## Project Objectives
- Create a hierarchical 3D model with articulated joints
- Implement coordinated animations between objects
- hierarchical modeling in a 3D environment
- Explore lighting and shadow projection in Three.js
- Develop basic user interaction in a 3D scene

---

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Three.js
- WebGL

---

## Interactions
- **Button:** Turn the lamp light on and off

---

## My Contribution
- Modeling of articulated components
- Implementation of hierarchical transformations
- Animation logic and sequencing
- Lighting and shadow configuration
- User interaction (light toggle)
